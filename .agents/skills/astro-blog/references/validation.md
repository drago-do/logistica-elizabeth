# Phase 5: Validation

## Pre-Publish Checklist

Run through ALL checks before publishing. If ANY critical check fails, go back and fix.

---

## 🟣 HUMAN VOICE CHECK (Must Pass First)

**Before any other checks, ensure content sounds human-written.**

### The Human Test

Read the article aloud and ask:

1. **Voice:** Would a human expert write it this way?
2. **Variety:** Can you read 3 paragraphs without seeing a pattern?
3. **Flow:** Do transitions feel natural or forced?
4. **Pacing:** Are components enhancing or interrupting?
5. **Authenticity:** Does it sound like a person or a template?

### Component Density Check

| Article Type | Max Components | Your Count | Pass/Fail |
|--------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Standard (1000-1500w) | 5-7 total | _____ | ☐ |
| Pillar (2500+w) | 8-12 total | _____ | ☐ |

**Count:**
- QueryAnswer: ___
- TL;DR: ___
- ExpertInsight: ___ (max 1-2 standard, 2-3 pillar)
- EngagementHook: ___ (max 0-2 standard, 2-4 pillar)
- ExperienceBlock: ___
- CTAs: ___ (max 2-3)

**If component count is excessive, rewrite with more clean prose.**

### Paragraph Variety Check

- [ ] Not every paragraph starts with answer-first pattern
- [ ] Mix of narrative, answer-first, and build-up styles
- [ ] Transitions sound natural (not repetitive)
- [ ] Entity mentioned naturally (not forced into subject position every sentence)

### AI Pattern Detection

**Scan for these AI-like patterns:**

- [ ] NO robotic answer-first in every paragraph
- [ ] NO components breaking up text every 300 words
- [ ] NO identical sentence structures repeated
- [ ] NO backwards phrasing for entity salience
- [ ] NO template-like predictability
- [ ] NO perfect spelling/grammar (should have 1-3 subtle typos)

**If 2+ AI patterns detected, rewrite for human voice before proceeding.**

### Intentional Imperfection Check

**Human typos present (2-4 per 1500-word article):**

- [ ] Contains 2-4 realistic typing errors (transposed letters, consonant errors, missing letters)
- [ ] Typos placed in conversational sections (NOT in headings/CTAs/stats)
- [ ] Mix of typo types: thier, recieve, definately, enviroment, occured, seperate
- [ ] NO grammar errors: your/you're, there/their, its/it's, then/than
- [ ] NO typos in QueryAnswer, H2s, CTAs, or schema markup

**These should look like an educated expert typing fast (hand errors), not grammar ignorance (head errors).**

**If content is perfectly spelled, add 2-4 educated typing errors in conversational sections.**

See `references/human-voice.md` section "Intentional Imperfection" for guidance.

## 🔴 Critical Checks (Must Pass)

### AI Hallucination Guardrails

**ExperienceBlock data MUST be verified or flagged.**

When AI generates content, it often invents realistic-sounding numbers and case studies. This is dangerous for E-E-A-T.

#### Rules for ExperienceBlock

1. **Real data only** — Numbers must come from:
   - Actual client records (anonymized)
   - Published company statistics
   - Verified industry data with source

2. **Placeholder pattern** — If real data unavailable:
```markdown
<ExperienceBlock type="case-study" placeholder="true">
**[PLACEHOLDER - NEEDS REAL DATA]**
Example structure:
- Client: [Name/Anonymized]
- Route: [From → To]
- Cost breakdown: [Itemized]

⚠️ Replace with actual case before publishing.
</ExperienceBlock>
```

3. **Verification markers**
```yaml
# In frontmatter
experienceVerified: false  # Set true only after human verification
```

4. **Build gate for unverified content**
```typescript
if (hasExperienceBlock && !frontmatter.experienceVerified) {
  warnings.push(
    `⚠️ "${post.data.title}" has ExperienceBlock but experienceVerified: false. 
     Human must verify data before publishing.`
  );
}
```

#### Forbidden in ExperienceBlocks

- Round numbers without source ("about 500 moves")
- Invented client names
- Estimated percentages
- "Typical" or "average" without data source
- Any statistics the AI "generated"

#### Safe Patterns

✅ **Verified real data:**
```markdown
Based on our 2024 records ([N] completed projects):
- Average cost: £X
- Source: Internal CRM data, Jan-Dec 2024
```

✅ **Industry data with citation:**
```markdown
UK average service cost is £X (Industry Association 2024 Survey).
```

✅ **Honest placeholder:**
```markdown
[INSERT: Real case study from CRM - recent project]
```

❌ **AI hallucination:**
```markdown
When we worked with the Johnson family last month... (invented)
Our data shows 73% of customers... (no source)
```

### Performance (HARD-RULES Compliance)

**Run Lighthouse audit on published page:**

| Metric | HARD-RULES Requirement | Your Score | Pass/Fail |
|--------|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| PageSpeed Mobile | ≥ 90 | _____ | ☐ |
| PageSpeed Desktop | ≥ 95 | _____ | ☐ |
| LCP | < 2.5s | _____ | ☐ |
| CLS | < 0.1 | _____ | ☐ |
| INP | < 200ms | _____ | ☐ |

**Bundle Size Checks:**

```bash
# After build, check bundle sizes
npm run build
du -sh dist/_astro/*.js | awk '{if ($1 > "100K") print "❌ JS too large: " $0; else print "✅ " $0}'
du -sh dist/_astro/*.css | awk '{if ($1 > "50K") print "❌ CSS too large: " $0; else print "✅ " $0}'
```

| Resource | HARD-RULES Limit | Your Size | Pass/Fail |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Total JS (gzipped) | < 100KB | _____ | ☐ |
| Total CSS (gzipped) | < 50KB | _____ | ☐ |

**Hydration Check:**

- [ ] NO `client:load` directives used (HARD-RULES forbidden)
- [ ] Interactive components use `client:visible` or `client:idle`
- [ ] Calculators/forms use `client:idle`

**If performance fails, optimize before proceeding.**

---

### Readability Metrics (Quality Standards)

**Run readability analysis on final content before publishing.**

#### Automated Scoring Tools

Use these tools to verify human comprehension:

1. **Hemingway Editor** (hemingwayapp.com)
   - Target: Grade 6-8
   - Max Grade 10 for general audience
   - Highlights complex sentences (5+ recommended)
   - Shows passive voice, adverb overuse

2. **Flesch Reading Ease** (readabilityformulas.com)
   - Target: 60-70 (Plain English)
   - Formula: 206.835 - 1.015(total words/sentences) - 84.6(syllables/words)
   - Scoring: 60-70 = Easily understood by 13-15 year olds

3. **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**
   - Target: Grade 8-10
   - Max Grade 12 for technical content
   - Formula: 0.39(words/sentences) + 11.8(syllables/words) - 15.59

4. **Grammarly Clarity Score** (optional)
   - Target: >80
   - Checks sentence clarity, word choice, conciseness
   - Flags jargon and complex phrasing

#### Manual Readability Checks

| Check | Pass Criteria | Your Score | Pass/Fail |
|-------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Hemingway Grade | 6-8 (max 10) | _____ | ☐ |
| Flesch Reading Ease | 60-70 | _____ | ☐ |
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | 8-10 (max 12) | _____ | ☐ |
| Average sentence length | 15-20 words | _____ | ☐ |
| Sentences >25 words | <20% of total | _____ | ☐ |
| Passive voice | <10% of sentences | _____ | ☐ |

#### Readability By Content Type

| Content Type | Hemingway Grade | Flesch Ease | Target Audience |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| General service | 6-7 | 65-75 | Homeowners |
| Technical guide | 8-9 | 55-65 | DIY enthusiasts |
| Professional | 9-10 | 50-60 | Trade/contractors |
| YMYL (health/finance) | 6-8 | 60-70 | General public |

#### What to Do If Scores Fail

**Hemingway Grade > 10:**
- Break long sentences (25+ words) into two
- Replace complex words with simpler alternatives
- Remove unnecessary adverbs ("very", "really", "extremely")
- Convert passive voice to active

**Flesch Reading Ease < 60:**
- Reduce average sentence length (aim for 15-20 words)
- Use shorter words (prefer 1-2 syllables)
- Break up dense paragraphs (max 80 words)
- Add transition sentences between complex ideas

**Too many complex sentences:**
- Vary sentence length (short + medium + long)
- Start paragraphs with punchy short sentences (5-10 words)
- Use lists for multi-step instructions
- Add subheadings to break sections

#### Readability Examples

❌ **Bad (Hemingway Grade 14, Flesch 45):**
```markdown
Solar panel installation, which involves numerous considerations that homeowners need to carefully evaluate before proceeding with their decision, varies significantly based on multiple factors including your roof's size and orientation, the quality and efficiency rating of the panels you select, and whether you choose to add battery storage systems, which can substantially increase the total investment by thousands of pounds but provide valuable backup power capabilities during grid outages.
```
(92 words, 1 sentence, exhausting)

✅ **Good (Hemingway Grade 7, Flesch 68):**
```markdown
Solar panel installation involves several key decisions.

The cost varies based on your roof size, panel quality, and whether you add battery storage. Battery systems increase the total by £2,000-£3,000, but they provide backup power during outages.

Most installations complete in 1-2 days. The planning process takes 4-6 weeks including surveys and quotes.
```
(Short opening + medium paragraphs, scannable)

#### Tools Integration

**Add to validation script:**

```typescript
// Readability score checks (using readability-metrics library)
const readability = analyzeReadability(content);

if (readability.hemingwayGrade > 10) {
  warn(`Hemingway grade is ${readability.hemingwayGrade} (target: 6-8, max: 10)`);
}

if (readability.fleschReadingEase < 60) {
  warn(`Flesch Reading Ease is ${readability.fleschReadingEase} (target: 60-70)`);
}

if (readability.avgSentenceLength > 22) {
  warn(`Average sentence length is ${readability.avgSentenceLength} words (target: 15-20)`);
}

if (readability.passiveVoicePercent > 10) {
  warn(`${readability.passiveVoicePercent}% passive voice (target: <10%)`);
}

if (readability.sentencesOver25Words / readability.totalSentences > 0.2) {
  warn(`${Math.round(readability.sentencesOver25Words / readability.totalSentences * 100)}% of sentences exceed 25 words (target: <20%)`);
}
```

**Recommended npm package:**
```bash
npm install text-readability --save-dev
```

- [ ] 5-10 entities mentioned throughout naturally
- [ ] No forced backwards phrasing for entity positioning

### Writing Variety

- [ ] Answer-first used strategically (not every paragraph)
- [ ] Mix of narrative, answer-first, and build-up styles
- [ ] Transitional phrases used sparingly (not repetitively)
- [ ] No excessive use of forbidden phrases as filler

### Statistics

- [ ] Every number has a source
- [ ] No "Studies show..." without citation
- [ ] No round numbers without evidence

## Content Freshness Strategy (Post-Publish)

Search engines and LLMs prioritize fresh, updated content. Implement a systematic refresh strategy.

### Update Triggers

**Immediate updates required:**
- **Regulatory changes** - New laws, building regulations, certification requirements
- **Major price shifts** - Industry-wide cost increases >15%
- **Safety recalls or warnings** - Product/service safety issues
- **Factual errors reported** - Incorrect data or outdated information

**Scheduled reviews:**
- **Commercial content** - 6-month review cycle (pricing, quotes, availability)
- **Informational content** - 12-month review cycle (general advice, how-tos)
- **Comparison content** - 6-month review cycle (product/service changes)
- **YMYL content** - 3-month review cycle (health, finance, legal)
- **Seasonal content** - Annual review before peak season

**Data-driven triggers:**
- Rankings drop >5 positions for primary keyword
- Click-through rate decreases >20% month-over-month
- Competitor publishes more recent content on same topic
- "People Also Ask" questions change significantly

### Update Protocol

**Minor updates (no full rewrite):**
1. Update `updatedDate` in frontmatter
2. Change year in title if applicable ("2025" → "2026")
3. Update statistics with latest data
4. Add "Last updated: [Month Year]" banner at top
5. Review external links (check for 404s, replace outdated sources)
6. Update screenshots if UI/pricing changed

**Major updates (significant content changes):**
1. Add update note banner:
```markdown
> **Update [Month Year]:** This guide has been updated with [what changed].
> [Brief 1-2 sentence summary of changes].
```

2. Update frontmatter:
```yaml
pubDate: 2025-01-15    # original publish date (don't change)
updatedDate: 2026-01-20  # most recent update
```

3. Update schema `dateModified` field

4. Re-submit to Google Search Console for indexing

**When to create new article instead:**
- Topic has fundamentally changed (old advice no longer applicable)
- Regulatory environment completely different
- URL/slug needs to change for better keyword targeting
- Original article was low quality and needs complete rewrite

### Freshness Signals to Include

**Explicit date mentions:**
```markdown
✅ "As of January 2026, UK solar installation costs average £6,200..."
✅ "The 2026 Smart Export Guarantee rates range from 4-7p per kWh..."
✅ "Updated building regulations (effective April 2026) now require..."
```

**Current statistics:**
- Include publication year in citation: "(ONS 2025)"
- Use "latest available data" when most recent
- State data collection period: "January-December 2025 data shows..."

**Visual freshness:**
- Update screenshots showing current UI/pricing
- Replace dated imagery (clothing styles, car models, technology)
- Update charts/graphs with current year data

**Updated examples:**
- Case studies from last 12 months
- Current product versions/models
- Recent client projects (with dates)

### Freshness Checklist

Before marking update complete:

- [ ] `updatedDate` field updated in frontmatter
- [ ] Year in title updated (if year-specific content)
- [ ] All statistics reviewed and updated/re-verified
- [ ] External links checked (no 404s, sources still credible)
- [ ] Screenshots updated if UI/pricing changed
- [ ] "Last updated" banner added at top (if major update)
- [ ] Schema `dateModified` field updated
- [ ] Update note added explaining what changed (if significant)
- [ ] Re-submitted to Google Search Console
- [ ] Internal links to this page still relevant

### Update Note Examples

**Minor update:**
```markdown
> **Last updated: January 2026** - Pricing data and statistics refreshed with latest industry figures.
```

**Major update:**
```markdown
> **Update January 2026:** This guide has been updated to reflect the new MCS certification requirements (effective April 2026) and updated Smart Export Guarantee rates. Average installation costs have increased 8% year-over-year.
```

**Regulatory change:**
```markdown
> **Important Update (March 2026):** Building regulations changed on 1 April 2026. All new installations now require additional electrical safety certification. This guide reflects the updated requirements.
```

### Tracking Updates

**Maintain update log** (in frontmatter or separate file):

```yaml
updateHistory:
  - date: 2026-01-20
    type: minor
    changes: "Updated pricing data, refreshed statistics"
  - date: 2025-07-15
    type: major
    changes: "Added new MCS requirements, updated installation process"
  - date: 2025-01-15
    type: publish
    changes: "Initial publication"
```

**Analytics to monitor:**
- Organic traffic trend after update
- Rankings for primary keyword (should stabilize/improve within 2-4 weeks)
- Click-through rate from search results
- Time on page (should increase if update improved content)

---

## Common Failures & Fixes

### "Missing TL;DR"
Add after QueryAnswer:
```markdown
<TLDRBlock>
**Key Takeaways:**
- Point 1 with specific number
- Point 2 with actionable advice
- Point 3 with key fact
</TLDRBlock>
```

### "Vague H2 detected"
Change from:
❌ `## Overview`
To:
✅ `## What factors affect service costs?`

### "Bad anchor text"
Change from:
❌ `[click here](/calculator)`
To:
✅ `[instant quote calculator](/calculator)`

### "No Information Gain signals"
Add one of:
- Specific case study
- Original data point with source
- Expert quote with name
- Contrarian insight with evidence

### "YMYL needs named author"
Change frontmatter:
```yaml
author: john-smith  # instead of 'team'
ymyl: true
```

Ask yourself:

1. **Would I cite this?** If you were writing an article, would you link to this as a source?

2. **What's unique?** Can you point to ONE thing this article has that competitors don't?

3. **Is the answer immediate?** Can someone find the answer without scrolling?

4. **Are claims backed?** Every statistic traceable to a source?

5. **Is intent clear?** Does the CTA make sense for what the reader wants?

   | Quick guide | 1-2 from pillars | Within 30 days |
   
   **Action checklist:**

   - [ ] Add contextual links to new content from those articles
   - [ ] Update cluster articles to reference new pillar
